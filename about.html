          <p>My full name is Melanie Joy Tabroff (I usually go by Mel), and I love climbing trees!</p>
          <p>…actually, what makes me most happy is just being outside whenever I have the chance. When I’m not working on design projects, you can find me running along Hudson River Park, citi-biking, or power walking through my favorite neighborhoods, like a true New-Yorka!</p>

        <div class="body">
          <p>About a year ago I made the decision to enroll in an online intensive program for UX Design and Front-end development, and since then I’ve been doing freelance UX research and marketing for an ed tech startup.</p>
          <p>What led me to make the decision to pursue UX was simple: I spent a good amount of time working alongside designers and developers at my previous jobs (at both a real estate startup and creative agency), and I always felt drawn to their work. The more I researched, the more excited I became about UX.</p>
          <p>What solidified the decision for me, though, was realizing that there were aspects of UX I was already doing in my previous roles (problem-solving wasn’t anything new to me. Adobe Suite, on the otherhand, was…).</p>
          <p>I’m also naturally curious about people and how they think, so the ability to design products and experiences for people really gets me pumped!</p>

      <!-- my philosophy-->
      <div class="about-section">
        <div class="title3">My philosophy<span class="lighter-color">— Hygge</span></div>
        <div class="body">
          <p>When I traveled to Copenhagen I discovered Hygge [‘HOO-gah”], which loosely translates to “coziness.” From what I understand, Hygge is all about designing your life to support happiness, good health, and wellbeing. I’m a big Hygge enthusiast and try to make a daily effort to do the things that inspire me and make me happy. This means drinking a good cup of coffee and working on projects that I believe in.
