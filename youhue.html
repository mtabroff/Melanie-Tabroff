<!-- Main Content
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-->
<section class="content-container">
    <div class="section-title">My role</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>I joined the YouHue team in May 2017 when it launched V1.0 of its app. As a freelance UX researcher and designer, I’ve been working on helping the team research and define its audience, collect product feedback, and explore ways we can improve our brand and product to support the needs of educators.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-title">A conversation about conversations</div>
    <div class="body">
          <p>During a team brainstorming meeting, the idea of creating a chatbot version of the app came up. The chatbot would replicate the core mood-logging exercise of the current app but through a conversational interface. This would open up opportunities to improve the user experience for students and teachers.</p>
          <p>The idea was expressed after reviewing common concerns from current and potential users, such as:</p>
          <br>
            <div class="title-blue">Cross platform compatability</div>
              <div class="user-quote">“My school doesn’t have iPads. When will YouHue be available on other platforms??”</div>
            <div class="title-blue">Engagement Drop-off</div>
              <div class="user-quote">“…I’m finding it more difficult to keep my students engaged with the YouHue app.”</div>
            <div class="title-blue">Knowing how to act on data</div>
              <div class="user-quote">“I love that my students log their moods on YouHue… but I’m having trouble knowing what to do with all this data. Am I missing something?”</div>
            <br>
            <p>A chatbot could potentially solve these limitations: It could be easily accessed on multiple devices. Its conversational nature would feel more “human-like,” which, in turn, can help increase student engagement. More engagement means more data capture. More data capture means more opportunities for teachers to help their students. Plus, students are so used to texting! The chatbot interface could feel more dynamic, fluid, and familiar.</p>
            <p>Of course, there are limitations with chatbot technology and no guarantee that re-building the product will solve problems for users. But, why not explore the idea a bit further?</p>
     </div>

     <div class="section-title">Design challenge<span class="lighter-color">– reimagine the product & sell it</span></div>
     <div class="body">
       <p>I set out to design a landing page for YouHue, that effectively:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>showcases a chatbot version of the app to guage interest in new functionality.</li>
         <li>educates users about the value of the app and how it can benefit educators.</li>
         <li>gains the trust and interest of educators to compel them to sign up for the pilot program.</li>

     <div class="body">
        <p>The idea for this project was on the heels of a long-standing discussion about redesigning our website and refining our brand communication strategy.  By creating a landing page to market a chat-bot version of the app, I figured the insights drawn from my research could transfer to the current website and shape our evolving content strategy. Essentially, this project allowed me to test a new product direction while honing our brand voice.</p>

<section class="content-container">
        <div class="section-title">Let's start<span class="lighter-color">— discover & strategize</span></div>
        <div class="body">
          <p>Before designing the chatbot version of the product and building its landing page, I needed to better understand the target audience and why a product, like YouHue, could be of any help to them.</p>

          <!-- Surveys
          ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-->
          <div class="italic-subtitle">Surveys</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>Through outreach on Teacher Facebook groups, I collected survey responses from 74 educators around the world.</p>
            <p>I set out to learn about their behaviors, e.g. do teachers already track student well-being? If so, how? Why would collecting this data be of value to them?</p>
            <div class="survey">
              <img src="./images/yh-survey-data.png">
            </div>
            <p>I also wanted to understand educators’ preconceptions with similar tools by asking open-ended questions:  Do teachers use similar mood-tracking/journalling apps? What about these products do they find useful? frustrating?</p>

            <!-- Synthesis
            ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-->

          <div class="italic-subtitle">Synthesis</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>Some of the key takeaways from survey results were that:<p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>Majority of educators agree that understanding students’ emotional needs are necessary for helping students learn.</li>
                              <li>Most educators track student wellbeing manually and not on a consistent basis.</li>
                              <li>Most educators believe 1:1 conversation is most valuable for checking-in with students, but having enough time to meet with each student can be a challenge.</li>
                              <li>Teachers have trouble knowing how to act on the data they collect.</li>
                              <li>Teachers don’t know how best to report this data to parents and faculty.</li>
                              <li>Teachers are skeptical about bringing new technology into classrooms due to on-boarding issues, time-suck, and getting approval from parents and administration.</li>
                       </ul>

          <div class="italic-subtitle">Interviews</div>
            <p>To go deeper with some of the questions and discuss teachers’ interest in using a student mood-tracking app, I selected 5 survey respondents and conducted phone interviews over the next few days.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="title6">Here are some highlights:</div>
                  <div class="user-quote">“As students become more aware of themselves as they get older, what is missing throughout that process (especially if they do not see the school psychologist) is the students’ own check in. They need to learn how to take time for themselves to reflect.”</div>
                    <hr class="line-break">
                  <div class="user-quote">"The challenge with 1:1 conversations is the time element as well as being able to hold that meaningful conversation at the right moment. Having a tool that my students could go to at the exact moment when they feel stressed or down would be a huge help to them and me!"</div>
                    <hr class="line-break">
                  <div class="user-quote">"Kids are scared to show vulnerability. When you ask them to write down how they feel it’s easier to get them to open up. I think a tool like YouHue could be super powerful as long as it’s bubbly and human-like, so that kids feel safe connecting with it and revealing about themselves."</div>

                <p>The goal of my research was to familiarize myself with chatbot technology and learn how it’s being used in education and the wellness space.</p>
                <p>Diving deeper into my research, I narrowed my focus to five products that most closely align with YouHue’s brand identity and product offerings: Woebot, Wysa, ClassDojo, Zones of Regulation, and Mood Meter app. My goal was to understand how these companies present and communicate about themselves to their respective audiences.</p>

            <p>Armed with new insights, I collaborated with key stakeholders to hone our brand communication strategy. This meant a complete brand audit to refine aspects of our brand (i.e. our company mission, brand personality, key values etc.) to resonate more effectively with our target audience.</p>
            <p>I took inspiration from WoeBot and ClassDojo, two competitors that most closely align to YouHue in terms of product and brand personality.</p>

          <p>With each section and its content properly outlined, I was prepared to build the wireframes. I used the tool Platform as a starting point to design the basic skeleton. I then used Land-Book and screen shots from competitor’s landing pages for additional inspiration on layout. Once I had a clear idea for how the content would be presented on the page, I used Sketch to design more polished med-fi wireframes and inserted the copy into the designs to ensure fit.</p>
