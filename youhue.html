      <p>I joined the YouHue team in May 2017 when it launched V1.0 of its app. As a freelance UX researcher and designer, I’ve been working on helping the team research and define its audience, collect product feedback, and explore ways we can improve our brand and product to support the needs of educators.</p>

          <p>As an early-stage startup, the primary goal is determining market fit. While the founders hustle to push the app into the hands of teachers and students, there has been a lack of resources dedicated to building a strong brand identity and online presence.</p>
          <p>For example, the old website and marketing materials were:</p>

          <br>
          <ul>

                 <span class="bolder">Not optimized for lead generation</span></li>

               <span class="bolder">Exhibited Information overload</span></li>
            <p>Amount of information (while quality research) felt overwhelming and difficult to skim</p>

            <p>Some of the key takeaways from survey results were that:<p>
                    <ul>
                          <li>Majority of educators agree that understanding students’ emotional needs are necessary for helping students learn.</li>
                          <li>Most educators track student wellbeing manually (e.g. written notes) and not on a consistent basis.</li>
                          <li>Most educators believe 1:1 conversation is most valuable for checking-in with students, but having enough time to meet with each student can be a challenge.</li>
                          <li>Teachers have trouble knowing how to act on the data they collect.</li>
                          <li>Teachers don’t know how best to report this data to parents and faculty.</li>
                          <li>Teachers are skeptical about bringing new technology into classrooms due to on-boarding issues, time-suck, and getting approval from parents and administration.</li>

                   <div class="italic-subtitle">Feature sections</div>

                   <p>One of the primary goals behind the redesign was conveying the value of the app to educators in a compelling way without overloading them with information. I set out to accomplish this by simplifying the copy and utilizing visuals to aid in storytelling.
                    <p>For the purpose of the first round of testing, I set out to determine whether the copy alone was clear and compelling enough before designing the visuals to support it.</p>
                    <p>I chose to separate the feature section into two parts: explaining how the app helps students in one section and how the data from the app helps teachers in another.</p>
                    <p> The feedback from testers was overall positive, in that they felt it was easy to understand what YouHue is and how it works. However, there was enough confusion over the 'Key-topic Analysis' feature that I knew I either had to add a ‘learn more’ CTA to give educators a way to find out more information, or provide an example with visuals to support the copy.</p>

                  <p>The feedback from the first round of testing gave me several ideas for how to improve the landing page. I set out to:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Refine the ‘What YouHue can do for educators’ section, specifically the part about the keyword analysis, to be more clear.</li>
                      <li>Add 'Learn More' CTAs to give educators a way to find out more information if interested.</li>
                      <li>Make ‘Get in Touch’ its own section where users can send an email directly on the site.</li>
                      <li>Add or update a section to include “How YouHue is used in the classroom" since this is a very common question.</li>
                  </ul>
          </div>

      <p>Creating YouHue’s landing page was an opportunity for me to distill the most important elements of the brand and product into a visually engaging and informative display.</p>
      <p>While these designs are not currently be used in the YouHue website, the process of refining our brand strategy has helped strengthen our brand voice and brought new business.</p>
