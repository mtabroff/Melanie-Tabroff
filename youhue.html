                          <li>Most educators believe 1:1 conversation is most valuable for checking-in with students, but having enough time to meet with each student can be a challenge.</li>
                          <li>Teachers have trouble knowing how to act on the data they collect.</li>
                          <li>Teachers don’t know how best to report this data to parents and faculty.</li>

                <p>Diving deeper into my research, I narrowed my focus to five products that most closely align with YouHue’s brand identity and product offerings: Woebot, Wysa, ClassDojo, Zones of Regulation, and Mood Meter app. My goal was to understand how these companies present and communicate about themselves to their respective audiences.</p>

                  <p>One of the primary goals behind the redesign was conveying the value of the app to educators in a compelling way without overloading them with information. I set out to accomplish this by simplifying the copy and utilizing visuals to aid in storytelling.
                  <p> The feedback from testers was overall positive, in that they felt it was easy to understand what YouHue is and how it works. However, there was enough confusion over the 'Key-topic Analysis' feature that I knew I either had to add a ‘learn more’ CTA to give educators a way to find out more information, or provide an example with visuals to support the copy.</p>

          <p>With every new project, I like to create moodboards to draw inspiration for my visual designs. I used Land-book to peruse beautifully-designed landing pages and pinpoint elements I liked, asking myself: what makes these designs successful? How do they use visuals to communicate a message?</p>
          <p>I specifically looked for landing pages that showcased data-driven products to see how complex graphs and tables were illustrated in simple, approachable ways.</p>

      <p>I wanted the visuals to complement YouHue’s refined brand strategy while utilizing the product brand guidelines created by the designers of the app. I accomplished this by making subtle yet visible adjustments to the color palette, logo, and typography.<p>

           <div class="italic-subtitle">Revised color palette</div>
           <div class="body">
                 <p>I modified the color palette (slightly!) to reflect the newly identified brand characteristics: energetic, trustworthy, playful, smart and caring.</p>
                 <p>The most apparent change was adjusting the YouHue brand color from a dark violet to a bold, energizing blue-violet. I also added subtle purple gradient backgrounds to attract attention and communicate a soft vibrancy.</p>

            <div class="center-title">original layout vs. modified</div>

      <div class="italic-subtitle">Logo modification</div>
        <div class="body">I took the existing logo and adjusted it slightly to make room for a tagline “Reflect. Learn. Grow.” I used the Fibonacci Square to establish proportionality between the graphic mark, the name “YouHue” and the tagline. I then altered the colors to correspond with the new color pallette.</div>

        <div class="body">The font Omnes was used as primary typeface for the old marketing materials and website copy. Omnes, while it conveys the brand characteristics of care and friendliness, can be difficult to read as body text. I paired Omnes with Proxima Nova to aid in legibility and readability while also conveying a mature yet friendly message.</div>

      <p>Creating YouHue’s landing page was an opportunity for me to distill the most important elements of the brand and product into a visually engaging and informative display.</p>
      <p>While these designs are not currently be used in the YouHue website, the process of refining our brand strategy has helped strengthen our brand voice and brought new business.</p>
