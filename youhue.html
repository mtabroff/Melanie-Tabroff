  <!-- MY role -->
  <section class="content-container">
    <div class="title3">My role</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>I joined the YouHue team in May 2017 when it launched V1.0 of its app. As a freelance UX researcher and designer, I’ve been working on helping the team research and define its audience, collect product feedback, and explore ways we can improve our brand and product to support the needs of educators.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="title3">A conversation about conversations</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>During a team brainstorming meeting, the idea of creating a chatbot version of the app came up. The chatbot would replicate the core mood-logging exercise of the current app but through a conversational interface. This would open up opportunities to improve the user experience for students and teachers.</p>
      <p>The idea was expressed after reviewing common concerns from current and potential users, such as:</p>
      <br>
        <div class="title5">Cross platform compatability</div>
          <div class="user-quote">“My school doesn’t have iPads. When will YouHue be available on other platforms??”</div>
        <div class="title5">Engagement Drop-off</div>
          <div class="user-quote">“…I’m finding it more difficult to keep my students engaged with the YouHue app.”</div>
        <div class="title5">Knowing how to act on data</div>
          <div class="user-quote">“I love that my students log their moods on YouHue… but I’m having trouble knowing what to do with all this data. Am I missing something?”</div>
        <br>
        <p>A chatbot could potentially solve these limitations: It could be easily accessed on multiple devices. It’s conversational nature would feel more “human-like,” which, in turn, can help increase student engagement. More engagement means more data capture. More data capture means more opportunities for teachers to help their students. Plus, students are so used to texting! The chatbot interface could feel more dynamic, fluid, and familiar.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="title3">Design challenge<span class="lighter-color">– bring an idea to life</span></div>
     <div class="body">
       <p>Of course, there are limitations with chatbot technology and no guarantee that re-building the product will solve problems for users. But, why not explore the idea a bit further?</p>
       <p>I set out to design a landing page for YouHue, that effectively:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>educates users about the value of the app and how it can benefit educators.
</li>
         <li>gains the trust and interest of educators to compel them to sign up for the pilot program.</li>
         <li>showcases a chatbot version of the app to guage interest in new functionality. </li>
       </ol>

        <div class="title3">Let's start<span class="lighter-color">— discover & strategize</span></div>
        <div class="body">
          <p>Before designing the chatbot version of the product and building its landing page, I needed to better understand the target audience and why a product, like YouHue, could be of any help to them.</p>
          <div class="title4">Surveys</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>Through outreach on Teacher Facebook groups, I collected survey responses from 74 educators around the world.</p>
            <p>I set out to learn about their behaviors, e.g. do teachers already track student wellbeing? If so, how? Why would collecting this data be of value to teachers?</p>
