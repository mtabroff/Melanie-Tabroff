    <div class="title3">My role</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>I joined the YouHue team in May 2017 when it launched V1.0 of its app. As a freelance UX researcher and designer, I’ve been working on helping the team research and define its audience, collect product feedback, and explore ways we can improve our brand and product to support the needs of educators.</p>

    <div class="title3">A conversation about conversations</div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>During a team brainstorming meeting, the idea of creating a chatbot version of the app came up. The chatbot would replicate the core mood-logging exercise of the current app but through a conversational interface. This would open up opportunities to improve the user experience for students and teachers.</p>
      <p>The idea was expressed after reviewing common concerns from current and potential users, such as:</p>

        <div class="title5">Cross platform compatability</div>
          <div class="user-quote">“My school doesn’t have iPads. When will YouHue be available on other platforms??”</div>
        <div class="title5">Engagement Drop-off</div>
          <div class="user-quote">“…I’m finding it more difficult to keep my students engaged with the YouHue app.”</div>
        <div class="title5">Knowing how to act on data</div>
          <div class="user-quote">“I love that my students log their moods on YouHue… but I’m having trouble knowing what to do with all this data. Am I missing something?”</div>
