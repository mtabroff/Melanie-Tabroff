    <h2>Problem Framing</h2>
    <p>The FDA requires Principal Investigators (PIs) to sign off on forms that capture human data. Yet, TrialSpark PIs aren’t easily able to navigate to forms that require signoff without the help of coordinators. This is problematic for two reasons:</p>
    <p>1. CRCs are blocked without these signatures, causing them to wait unnecessarily long hours after a patient visit to physically meet with PIs.</p>
    <p>2. Remote patient visits are becoming more common, which means PIs and CRCs need to be able to execute all study tasks autonomously.</p>

 <h4 class="caption">Context</h3>
   <div class="definition">
          <p>When I started at TrialSpark, physicians were not accustomed to using Pilot software independently. Instead, they relied on research coordinators to help them sign in and navigate to the appropriate forms that required action. Pilot, at the time, was simply <span style="font-weight: bold">not built to support physicians’ workflows</span>. For example, there were no visual indicators from the homepage directing physicians to the specific forms that required their review. Moreover, the system lacked simple microinteractions, like tooltips and progress indicators, to make it easier for users to understand where to go and anticipate what will happen next.</p>

          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Obviously this was inefficient.</span> Coordinators had to repeatedly wait long hours (5+) after a patient visit to meet with physicians to get signatures.

      <h2 id="research">Research & Synthesis</h2>
     <p>If my team was to improve the electronic signature flow, we needed to understand the regulations around PI oversight: Why are signatures necessary? To what extent can we change the status quo?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="twoCol-center">
    <div>
      <h4>Regulation vs Guidelines</h4>
      <p>There is a lot of ambiguity around the interpretation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). When it comes to physician oversight, the FDA establishes general guidelines that can be translated broadly and (too often) inconsistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        This became apparent to me when interviewing CRCs who had varied experiences working with auditors and data monitors at the site level. I quickly discovered that varying degrees of leniency ultimately affect how coordinators approach physician oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, some CRCs held very conservative views on PI oversight (e.g. it’s necessary that my PI looks over and signs off on all forms in a timely manner to ensure accuracy and proper oversight, especially if an auditor were to investigate), while others seemed more lax (e.g. unless there’s an urgent matter, I don’t think it’s necessary for my PI to sign off on every form).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a company, we constantly have to weigh the potential benefits and risks of efficiency over thoroughness.

          <p>I literally have to quadruple check [Pilot] to ensure that all forms have been signed off. This can mean clicking into 20 forms sometimes... There’s no way around it. - CRC</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote3">
          <p>I don’t trust that my PI can navigate through Source without accidentally modifying data. I feel better helping him in-person so that I can answer any questions. My PI is smart, obviously, but not the most tech-savvy. - CRC</p>

       <h2>Learnings & Reflection</h2>
          <p class="definition">After each design sprint, my team liked to debrief with an exercise called “I like, I wish, I wonder…” to gather open and honest feedback. Here are my takeaways:</p>
       
       <div class="twoCol-left">
           <div>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I like</span> that design and engineering collaborated closely and efficiently so that we could incorporate the new UI system into the feature rollout. I also like that we were able to involve CRCs in the design process, ensuring that we were addressing their pain points head on.</p>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I wish</span> that we could have challenged the status quo by making more meaningful changes to the signature flow (e.g. batch signoff, sign via mobile instead of desktop, eliminating signatures altogether). However, this would have required much more time and cross-functional effort to align with clinical study team stakeholders and could have risked negatively impacting our relationship with conservative pharmaceutical companies (trial sponsors).</p>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I wonder</span> how long it would have taken us to prioritize these changes if COVID-19 had not impacted our ability to conduct in-person studies. Though CRC & PI user pain points had existed for a long time, there wasn’t a strong enough business reason to divert engineering resources towards addressing them. However, given how quickly the world around us can change the needs of a business and it’s users, it is even more important to be able to adapt quickly.</p>
