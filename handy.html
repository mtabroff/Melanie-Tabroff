            <p>Handy is an online two-sided marketplace for cleaning and home services. One of their biggest revenue drivers is recurring home cleaning– offering customers 3mo, 6mo, and 12mo subscription plans. As the lead designer for the cleaning growth team, I helped design and optimize opportunities for new customers to commit to cleaning subscription plans.</p>

            <div class="body">
              <p>As a product designer on the growth team, I worked closely with product managers, engineers, and marketers to define what we were going to test, what metrics we wanted to improve, and then analyze the results to decide how best to move forward.</p>
              <p>My job was to figure out what those tests would look like, whether as simple as a few copy changes to as "meaty" as a new user flow. I was also responsible for user research – customer calls, surveys, and competitor analyses– and regularly presented key insights to my team. My research both informed potential solutions to test and helped us contextualize results.</p>

              <p>How can we get more customers to sign up for cleaning subscription plans without changing our pricing model?</p>

             <div class="section-title">What did we do? How did we get there?</div>
             <div class="body">
                   <p>As a team we brainstormed a bunch of strategies for improving conversion (subscription sign ups), some of which would live within the product itself (e.g. changing UI elements in the checkout flow) and some that were outside the product (e.g. automated bounce emails to customers).</p>
                   <p>Understanding the customer journey– how customers engage with Handy across all touchpoints– was key to identifying both online and offline opportunities to draw customers further down the purchase funnel.</p>

              <div class="body">
                <p>Customers land on Handy.com from a lot of different places–  from googling “where can I find a nearby cleaning service” to clicking on catchy Facebook ads.</p>

                  <p>Once the customer lands on Handy’s cleaning service landing page (we call the “When” page), the customer is asked to fill in basic job details and email address to get a price. Next, the customer is brought to the “Payment” page–or checkout page–where the price of the service is revealed. Here users are asked to choose a cleaning plan, specify if they want add-ons (eg cleaning inside fridge), put in payment details and confirm their booking–voila!

                  <p>After countless customer calls, emails, and surveys with customers from various stages of the funnel (pre to post booking), common painpoints emerged. I looked at competitors to understand how they tackle some of the painpoints and created an affinity map to helped me visually patterns and opportunities: </p>

                  <p>After breaking down the customer journey and understanding their mindset, the team distilled three main opportunities for engaging customers more effectively:</p>

                    </br>People who reach the payment page (without completing a booking) are 50% more likely to return at least once within 14 days.<p>

            <p>Both Product and Marketing built a roadmap of experiments which we tracked together. Below I outline the main tests I helped design.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="title-med">TEST 1: UI changes on Payment Page</div>
              <img src="images/UI-tests-overview.png" width=100%>
            <div class="body">
            </br>
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we add visual cues to help reduce anxiety around purchase commitment, more customers will book.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span> feedback from customer calls around purchase anxiety</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Test overview:</span> We A/B tested a bunch of options, like cta button color  (green vs blue), cta button copy (“confirm booking” vs “ accept & continue”), addition of value props, urgency badges, more clearly highlighting coupon on the receipt, etc.<p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Outcome:</span> Win for Payment call outs</p>
              <p>Overall most simple ui changes didn’t move the needle. Letting customers know we won’t collect payment before 24 hours of service was the biggest win for When to Payment, with an even greater win on mweb than web. This told us that we were on the right track in terms of reducing customer anxiety around payment.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="title-med">TEST 2: Personalization</div>
          </br>
            <img src="images/Personalization-Test.png" width=100%>
            <div class="body">
            </br>
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we personalize the return experience (for logged-out users), new customers will feel more at ease about booking and will more likely commit.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span> a) Majority of customers return to site at least twice before making a booking. b) Customers are accustomed to personalization.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Test overview:</span> Normally returning customers have to re-enter their service details on the When page in order to complete a booking. We wanted to personalize the return experience for logged out customers to make completing a booking more seamless. The team used Google Optimize to test personalized copy changes to avoid unnecessary development work (to note: the designs were limited by the constraints of Google Optimize software).</p>
                <p>We created a simple A/B test: the experimental group of returning customers were brought to a personalized "When" page that was auto-filled. Control was brought to the normal “When” page. The key metrics we measured was click rate (W->P) and conversion rate (completed bookings).</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Outcome:</span> Inconclusive / Paused</P>
              <p>Click rate from When to Payment was higher for the experimental group (as expected), meaning more returning customers were going through the checkout flow when landing on a personalized page. However, in terms of conversion (actually completing the booking) we did not see a significant increase.</p>
              <p>The test taught us that sometimes customers need more convincing than simply a reminder that they have already visited the site. It also taught us that personalization extends beyond “welcome back” copy.</p>

              <br>
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we remove payment from checkout flow, more customers will book. The more customers that complete a booking, the more opportunities we have to acquire paying customers.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span> a) Price is the number one reason customers hesitate (due to lack of perceived value or inability to pay full amount upfront)</li> b) Customers expect to be able to pay after service is complete (common expectation in service industry)</li>
                  c) Customers desire instant gratification. d) Flexible payment options (e.g. Interest payments) is becoming a new norm.</p>

              <p><span class="new-style">Test overview:</span> This was our most risky test and most intensive from a development standpoint because it required breaking legacy code. Our primary metric was completed conversion (paid bookings), which would determine which test “wins”. We also measured booking conversion (W->P) and monitored the two metrics for comparison.<p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Outcome:</span> Temporarily paused</p>
              <p>During testing we saw some surprising data: big win from the experiment in terms of booking and then major losses in completed bookings (collecting payment). On one hand, we understood this was to be expected. By lowering the risk of making a booking we would capture more low-intent customers. However, we later learned that there was a bug in the test that prevented customers from inputting payment details.</p>
              <p>Due to development constraints, we decided to pause the test.</p>

            <div class="body">
            </br>
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we reposition cleaning plans into fixed bundles (e.g. 3, 5 cleanings, 10 cleaning packs) then more customers will feel comfortable committing because the offer seems more flexible.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span> a) Customers who cancel say they are looking for a more flexible plan; they want to be able to schedule on own terms. b) Customers are fearful of commitment plans.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Test overview:</span> We wanted to test interest in cleaning packs as a potential alternative to subscription plans without cannibalizing conversion of packs.</p>
              <p>So, we set up a quick test to gauge customer interest in packs. I built a landing page using Unbounce. We set up a PDP on Handy’s site to collect payment for cleaning packs. New customers who had visited Handy were sent an email with a link to the product offerings. We measured click rate from Unbounce -> PDP on the Handy website. We also measured conversion: PDP-> payment.</p>

              <div class="image-data">
                <img src="images/Packs-user-flow.png" width=100%>
              </div>
              <p><span class="new-style">Outcome:</span> Temporarily paused</p>
              <p>Click rate from bounce to PDP was about equivalent to when->payment. This suggested that customers are interested in packs and that they could be a potential valuable offering alongside cleaning plans. However, completed bookings were not high enough to suggest that we offer packs as an alternative option to subscription plans at this time.</p>

          <div class="section-title">Key Learnings</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expect the unexpected</strong>
            </br>What seemed like a more “intuitive” or “better” user experience didn't necessarily perform better (e.g. personalization tests). This taught us that improving conversion takes more than small UX improvements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Can’t rely on the results of a single test to prove or disprove a hypothesis</strong>
            </br>Most of the tests were determined as inconclusive. This didn’t mean that our hypothesis was wrong but that we need more data / more testing to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>Importance of thinking like a psychologist</strong>
            </br>Understanding the customer mindset is absolutely necessary to improve business growth, and mindsets can change from day-to-day.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowing how to read numbers and evaluate context</strong>
            </br>So many times we’d review and the team would get excited about the potential results but the data wasn’t statistically significant, or we weren’t looking at the data in the right context.</li>
            <li><strong>Take customer feedback with a grain of salt</strong>
            </br>What people say and do are not always aligned and it’s helpful to test strategies and assumptions even when you think they’re not likely to succeed.</li>
          </ul>
        </br>
          <div class="section-title">Closing thoughts</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>Working in a growth role is exciting. It taught me about being comfortable with quick change and the importance of being aligned with a team on clear goals to test. I was also reminded how important it is, especially as a designer, to be an advocate for the customer.</p>
