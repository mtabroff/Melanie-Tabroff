            <p>Handy is an online two-sided marketplace for cleaning and home services. One of their biggest revenue drivers is recurring home cleaning– offering customers 3mo, 6mo, and 12mo subscription plans. As the lead designer for the cleaning growth team, I helped design and optimize opportunities for new customers to commit to cleaning subscription plans.</p>

            <div class="section-title">My role</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p>As a product designer on the growth team, I worked closely with product managers, engineers, and marketers to define what we were going to test, what metrics we wanted to move, and then analyze the results to decide how best to move forward.</p>
              <p>My job was to figure out what those tests would look like, whether as simple as a few copy changes to as meaty as a new user flow. I was also responsible for user research – customer calls, surveys, and competitor analyses– and regularly presented key insights to my team. My research both informed potential solutions to test and helped us contextualize results.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Design Challenge</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p>How can we get more customers to sign up for cleaning subscription plans without changing our pricing model?</p>

            <div class="section-title-above">The process</div>
             <div class="section-title">What did we do? How did we get there?</div>
             <div class="body">
                   <p>As a team we brainstormed a bunch of strategies for improving conversion (subscription sign ups), some of which would live on the product itself (e.g. changing UI elements in the checkout flow) and some that were outside the product (e.g. bounce emails to customers).</p>
                   <p>Understanding the customer journey– how customers engage with Handy across all touchpoints– was key to identifying both online and offline opportunities to draw customers further down the purchase funnel.</p>

              <div class="title-med">The customer journey</div>
              <div class="body">
                <p>Customers land on Handy.com from a lot of different places–  from googling “where can I find a nearby cleaning service” to clicking on catchy Facebook ads.</p>

                <div class="body">
                  <p>Once the customer lands on Handy’s cleaning service landing page (we call the “When” page), the customer is asked to fill in basic job details and email address to get a price. Next, the customer is brought to the “Payment” page–or checkout page–where the price of the service is revealed. Here users are asked to choose a cleaning plan, specify if they want add-ons (eg cleaning inside fridge), put in payment details and confirm their booking–voila!

                  <p>Knowing how customers go from shopping around to actually booking is the first step. The second is understanding the customer mindset, the emotions they experience which ultimately influence their decision making and purchase behavior.</p>
                  <p>After countless customer calls, emails and surveys with customers from various stages of the funnel (pre to post booking) I was able to segment customers into three categories:</p>

                  <p>After breaking down the customer journey and understanding their mindset, the team distilled three main opportunities for engaging customers more effectively:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Optimize Payment Page</strong>
                    <p><span class="new-style-1">Given that… (the data)</span>
                    </br>70% of users drop off from Payment page to When page and drop-off is even greater on mobile web than desktop.<p>

                  </br>Optimize the payment page (especially on mobile) to encourage new customers to make a booking?</p>

                    <li><strong>Personalize Return Experience</strong>
                    <p><span class="new-style-1">Given that… (the data)</span>
                    </br>People who reach the payment page (without completing a booking) are 50% more likely to return at least once within 14 days.<p>

                    </br>Personalize the return experience so we can make the process from payment to completed booking more seamless?</p>

                    </br>People who book cleaning subscription plans are 40% more likely to cancel before their first cleaning.</p>

          <div class="section-title">What we tested, why, and outcome</div>
            <div class="body">
            <p>Both Product and Marketing built a roadmap of experiments which we tracked together. Below I outline the main tests I helped design.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="title-med">TEST 1: UI changes on Payment Page</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we add visual cues to help reduce anxiety around purchase commitment, more customers will book.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span> feedback from customer calls around purchase anxiety</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Outcome:</span> win for Payment call outs.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="title-med">TEST 2: Personalization</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we personalize the return experience, customers will feel more at ease about booking and will be more likely to commit.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span> a) Majority of customers return to site at least twice before making a booking. b) Customers are accustomed to personalization. (Based on competitor analysis and consumer insights)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="title-med">TEST 3: Book now, Pay later</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we remove payment from checkout flow, more customers will book. The more customers that complete a booking, the more opportunities we have to acquire paying customers.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price is the number one reason customers hesitate (due to lack of perceived value or inability to pay full amount upfront)</li>
                    <li>Customers expect to be able to pay after service (common expectation in service industry)</li>
                    <li>“Put on hold” phenomenon: customers more likely to purchase a piece of clothing if they can put it on hold because invested time in imagining that they own it.</li>
                </ul>
              <p></p>
            </div>

            <div class="title-med">TEST 4: Reposition Cleaning subscriptions</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p><span class="new-style">Hypothesis:</span> If we reposition cleaning plans into fixed bundles  (e.g. 3, 5 cleanings, 10 cleaning packs) then more customers will feel comfortable committing because the offer seems more flexible.</p>
              <p><span class="new-style">Research to support:</span></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Customers who cancel say they are looking for a more flexible plan, want to schedule on own terms</li>
                  <li>Customers are skeptical about subscription services</li>
              <p></p>
            </div>




          <div class="section-title">Key Learnings</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expect the unexpected</strong>
            </br>What seemed like a more “intuitive” or “better” user experience didn't necessarily perform better (e.g. personalization tests). This taught us that improving conversion takes more than small UX improvements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Can’t rely on the results of a single test to prove or disprove a hypothesis</strong>
            </br>Most of the tests were determined as inconclusive. This didn’t mean that our hypothesis was wrong but that we need more data / more testing to understand.</li>
            <li><strong>Importance of thinking like a psychologist</strong>
            </br>Understanding the customer mindset is absolutely necessary to improve business growth, and mindsets can change from day-to-day.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowing how to read numbers and evaluate context</strong>
            </br>So many times we’d review and the team would get excited about the potential results, but data either wasn’t statistically significant. Often because weren’t looking at the data in the right context.</li>
            <li><strong>Take customer feedback with a grain of salt</strong>
            </br>What people say and do are not always aligned and it’s helpful to test strategies and assumptions even when you think they’re not likely to succeed.</li>
          </ul>
        </br>
          <div class="section-title">Closing thoughts</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>Working in a growth role is exciting. It taught me about being comfortable with quick change and the importance of being aligned with a team on a clear goal to test. I was also reminded how important it is, especially as a designer, to be an advocate for the customer.</p>
